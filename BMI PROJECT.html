    <h1 class="emoji">ü´Ä Cardiac Pacemakers: Design, Functionality, and Safety Standards in Biomedical Engineering</h1>
    <p>
        Cardiac pacemakers are essential in managing arrhythmias and ensuring proper heart function. 
        As these devices evolve, they must meet high standards in design, functionality, safety, and regulation. 
        Below are real-world inspired case summaries for each major area of study.
    </p>

    <section>
        <h2 class="emoji">üß© 1. Design of Pacemakers</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: Designing for Pediatric Patients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Small enough for a child‚Äôs chest</li>
            <li>Made of biocompatible materials (e.g., titanium casing)</li>
            <li>Safe for growth and long-term implantation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The team used flexible leads, reduced battery size, and made the housing MRI-safe. 
            Telemetry functions were integrated for non-invasive monitoring.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Pacemaker design must balance size, material choice, patient-specific needs, and future maintenance ease.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="emoji">‚öôÔ∏è 2. Functionality of Pacemakers</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: Adaptive Pacing in Elderly Patients</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sensors to detect physical activity</li>
            <li>Automatic heart rate adjustment based on movement</li>
            <li>Battery optimization algorithms</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As a result, the patient resumed walking and daily activities without fatigue or symptoms of a slow heart rate.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Functionality today includes sensor-based, intelligent pacing tailored to real-time physiological changes.</div>

    <section>
        <h2 class="emoji">‚ö° 3. Electrical Safety in Pacemaker Use</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: Interference in a High-EMI Environment</strong></p>
        <p>
            A woman with a pacemaker worked in a factory with heavy electric machinery. 
            She experienced occasional dizziness. Upon testing, doctors found electromagnetic interference (EMI) from nearby motors was affecting the pacemaker signal.
        </p>
        <p>
            The pacemaker was replaced with an EMI-resistant, shielded model that met 
            <strong>IEC 60601-1-2 EMI standards</strong>, eliminating the issue.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Electrical safety in design and deployment prevents malfunctions in EMI-rich environments, like hospitals or factories.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="emoji">üßæ 4. Regulatory and Safety Standards</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: FDA Recall and ISO Compliance</strong></p>
        <p>
            A batch of pacemakers was recalled by the FDA due to premature battery failure discovered in post-market reports. 
            The manufacturer had initially complied with <strong>ISO 14708-1</strong> and <strong>IEC 60601</strong>, 
            but a flaw in one supplier‚Äôs battery cells went unnoticed.
        </p>
        <p>
            A corrective action plan, new <strong>ISO 13485</strong>-compliant quality controls, and FDA audits were implemented to avoid recurrence.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Adhering to regulatory and safety standards is a continuous process involving design, testing, and ongoing quality control.</div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 class="emoji">üî¨ 5. Safety Testing and Validation</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: Clinical Trial of a Leadless Pacemaker</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Preclinical testing: Battery life, mechanical stress, biocompatibility</li>
            <li>Animal trials: Function and integration</li>
            <li>Human clinical trials: Evaluating safety in 500 patients</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The device achieved FDA approval after meeting stringent testing standards and is now on the market.
        </p>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Rigorous, multi-stage testing and validation is key to patient safety and regulatory approval.</div>

        <h2 class="emoji">üß¨ 6. Evolution and Types of Pacemakers</h2>
        <p><strong>Case Example: From External to Leadless Pacing</strong></p>
        <p>
            Mr. Patel had an external pacemaker in the 1980s that required bulky power sources. 
            Today, his son received a leadless pacemaker, inserted via a catheter and wirelessly monitored.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Key types involved:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Single-chamber pacemakers: Simpler, used for slower heart rhythms</li>
            <li>Dual-chamber pacemakers: Coordinate atrial and ventricular pacing for more natural rhythms</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="takeaway">‚úÖ Takeaway: Pacemaker evolution reflects leaps in miniaturization, wireless tech, and customization.</div>
