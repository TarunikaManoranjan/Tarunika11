    <h2>Bioinstrumentation & Artificial Intelligence</h2>
    <p>
      As a biomedical engineering student, I am deeply passionate about bioinstrumentation—the interface of biology and devices.
      With a foundation in electronics and biomedical systems, I explore real-time diagnostics, monitoring systems, and innovative health solutions.
      I am also intrigued by how AI is transforming diagnostics, predictive healthcare, and biomedical research.

      <h3>AI & Logic Game Project</h3>
      <p>
        I created an interactive AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game to demonstrate logical decision-making and simple AI flow. 
        This game serves as a fun example of algorithm-based interactivity aligned with biomedical tech interest.

    <h3>Evolution of Pacemakers (How They Changed Over Time)</h3>
    <p>Pacemakers have improved a lot since they were first created. Here’s how they developed over time:</p>

    <h4>Early Pacemakers (1930s–1950s)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>The first pacemakers were big and used outside the body.</li>
      <li>In 1958, doctors in Sweden made the first implantable pacemaker. It didn’t last long, but it was the beginning of modern pacemakers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Better Designs (1960s–1980s)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>New pacemakers had longer battery life (thanks to lithium batteries).</li>
      <li>Some could pace two heart chambers instead of just one.</li>
      <li>They became smaller and more reliable.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Modern Pacemakers (1990s–Today)</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Now pacemakers are very small and can be monitored remotely.</li>
      <li>Some are even MRI-safe.</li>
      <li>New types like leadless pacemakers don’t need wires at all.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Two Types of Pacemakers</h3>
    <h4>1. Single-Chamber Pacemaker</h4>
    <p><strong>What it does:</strong> Sends signals to just one part of the heart—either the upper part (atrium) or the lower part (ventricle).</p>
    <p><strong>When it’s used:</strong> For people whose heart beats too slowly, and only one chamber needs help.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it's good:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Simple to put in</li>
      <li>Fewer problems because it has only one wire</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Doesn’t work as well for people who need both chambers paced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>2. Leadless Pacemaker</h4>
    <p><strong>What it is:</strong> A very small pacemaker that goes directly into the heart—no wires or surgery needed on the chest.</p>
    <p><strong>When it’s used:</strong> For people who might have problems with wires or infections.</p>
    <p><strong>Why it's good:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>No scars</li>
      <li>Lower chance of infection</li>
      <li>Fast recovery</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
    <ul>
      <li>Works only for the lower part of the heart (ventricle)</li>
      <li>Can be hard to remove if there’s a problem</li>
    </ul>
